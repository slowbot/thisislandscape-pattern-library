<p class="lead">Geomechanical processes are known to play an important role in hydrogeological behavior. Linkage between mechanics and hydrogeology occurs in two fundamental ways: (1) through interactions between rock strain, the geometry of pores and fractures, and their permeability and porosity; and (2) through interactions between fluid pressure and rock mechanical stress. Modeling of hydromechanical coupling, with mechanistic representation of damage and fracture initiation/propagation, remains a major difficulty. However, such processes are of particular importance for mechanically weak geomaterials such as clays and shales.</p>
