<h2 class="delta rhythm">Historical Background</h2>

<p>ESD hydrogeologist Daisuke Asahina recently led a group of scientists (including ESD’s Jim Houseworth, Jens Birkholzer, and Jonny Rutqvist) in developing a modeling approach for studying hydromechanical coupled processes, including fracture development, within geological formations. They did this through the novel linking of two codes: TOUGH2, a widely used simulator of subsurface multiphase flow based on the finite volume method; and an implementation of the Rigid-Body-Spring Network (RBSN) method, which provides a discrete (lattice) representation of material elasticity and fracture development. The TOUGH–RBSN simulator predicts fracture evolution, as well as mass transport through permeable media, under dynamically changing hydrologic and mechanical conditions. The group compared their numerical results from the simulator with those of two independent studies involving hydro-mechanical coupling: (1) numerical modeling of swelling stress development in bentonite; and (2) experimental study of desiccation cracking in a mining waste. The comparisons show good agreement with respect to moisture content, stress development with changes in pore pressure, and time to crack initiation. The observed relationship between material thickness and crack patterns is captured by the proposed modeling approach.</p>
